        			<section>The growth of the emplyment of software engineer is projected to grow 17% between 2014 to 2024, whcih is much faster than the average growth for other careers. This is mainly due to the rapid increase of demands in computer fields. </section>

        			<section>Education Requirement</section>
        			<section>Typical entry level of Software Engineering is a <b>Bachelpr's Degree</b>, either in Computer Science or Software Enginnering. </section>
        			<section>In fact, many people who work as a software engineer have a Computer Science degree in the U.S, simply because the major 'Software Engineering' occurs 30 years after 'Computer Science'</section>

        			<section><br> While both majors require a <em>fundamentals in programming</em>, and <em>basic computer science theory</em>, Softeware Engineering focus more on the topics that are essential to the agenda.

        			<section>
        				<ol>
        					<li>Learn how to build software that is user-friendly:
        						<br> <ul><li>That is useful and usable by the user, and satisfy all their requirements</li></ul>
        					</li>
        					
        					
        				</ol>

        			2.Lig	ical and structured thinking & Pay attention to details!
        					<br><ul><li>Problems can arise from the smallest errors, and it might messed up the whole software, which requires patience and also problem solving ability (Think OUTSIDE of the box!)</li></ul>
        			</section>
        			<section>
        			3.MOST IMPORTANT ONE: know how to code in at least one language:
        						<br><ul>
        							<li>Phython</li>
        							<li>C++</li>

                    <section>Why Software Engineering interest me</section>
                    <section>Software Engineering covers a really broad area since almost everything have softwares installed in them. Going into software engineering means I am able to do almost everything related to STEM fields (not physically building things though). </section>
                    <section>And I always like the process of seeing something being created, I think software engineering is also a way to creat things. Software Engineers come up with ideas and write the programs together as a group, which is the perfect demonstration of what I like!</section>
                    <section>It is possible for me to build a video game; or write a program that help to diagnose datas, which is very helpful for researchers; and many other stuff! The variation of things that software engineering related to really opened a lot of doors and provide many opportunities for me! </section>
